### Transportation
***

All members are above the age of 21, **so all team members will be able to drive a rental vehicle**. So for ultimate conveinence, our team will rent 1-2 vehicles. All of our team members could squeeze into a modest Jeep Grand Cherokee, but where's the fun in that?

**Total Transportation budget= $570-$1520**

  <summary> Fuel Details </summary>

[Gas prices are $2.97 in Pasadena](https://www.gasbuddy.com/GasPrices/California/Pasadena). Estimating 7 hours of driving time every day with a [Jeep Cherokee at 21 miles/gallon in the city](https://www.google.com/search?q=mpg+for+jeep+cherokee&rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS728US729&oq=mpg+for+jeep+chero&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.4240j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

35mph avg speed in California * 7 hours driving time = 245 miles. 

245 miles/21 mpg = 11.6 gallons gas per day.

11.6 gallons * $3.00 = $35

$35 * 4 days + $17.50 * 1 day (last day will have little driving) = $157.50 or approx $160

Fuel Estimate 1 Vehicle= $160

Fuel Estimate 2 Vehicles=$320

To save money and have a cozy experience, we will be staying at an affordable "mid-century" AirBnB house in Pasadena for 4 nights at $104/night. It it conveniently located near Disneyland, Laguna Beach and other desirable California destinations. With 4 beds, only one team member will have to sleep on the sofa!

It is suggested that team members program a psuedo-random number generator to fairly decide who gets to sleep on the sofa.

Lodging Budget: $481

On Day 2, we are going for a full day trip to Disneyland! It will take us about an hour to get there, so we'll rise early and leave before 7 to get to the park when it opens! We will start our day there with breakfast at Carnation Cafe. We will be free to wander around Disneyland and its seven themed areas, making use of our MAXpass that allows us to make Fastpass tickets on our mobile devices, until we get hungry again and head to our lunch destination Bengal Barbecue.

We have two activities planned for the evening. First, a reservation for Fantasmic! Dining Packages for dinner at Blue Bayou at 6:00. There we get to eat dinner and view the Fantasmic! show.

On Day 3, we will get up early after cooking eggs and bacon and go to Laguna beach for a 2 hour surf lesson! Who cares that it's winter! After renting wetsuits and boards and surfing for the day, we will eat at snazzy places such as the Driftwood Kitchen and the famous Parkway Grill.

In the evening we will hit up the classy Speakeasy like VIP's, and then party as hard as a bunch of CS/IT nerds can manage at the swanky Club 54.
