We decided to plan the Flight, Transportation and Lodging first as constants, and then we planned the rest of the trip around these items.

To save money and have a cozy experience, we will be staying at an affordable "mid-century" AirBnB house in Pasadena for 4 nights at $104/night. It it conveniently located near Disneyland, Laguna Beach and other desirable California destinations. With 4 beds, only one team member will have to sleep on the sofa!

It is suggested that team members program a psuedo-random number generator to fairly decide who gets to sleep on the sofa.

Lodging Budget: $481

On Day 3, we will get up early after cooking eggs and bacon and go to Laguna beach for a 2 hour surf lesson! Who cares that it's winter! After renting wetsuits and boards and surfing for the day, we will eat at snazzy places such as the Driftwood Kitchen and the famous Parkway Grill.

In the evening we will hit up the classy Speakeasy like VIP's, and then party as hard as a bunch of CS/IT nerds can manage at the swanky Club 54.
