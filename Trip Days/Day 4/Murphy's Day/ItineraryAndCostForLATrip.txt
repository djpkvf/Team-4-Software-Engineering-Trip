We will go to The Rust Pot Cafe in Inglewood. This menu is eclectic to say the least an a meal compose of "The Bully Omelet"($14.00), Famous Belgian Waffle($7.50), the Scrambled Jamble($11.00), The Big Breakfast Burger($12.00), and an Overloaded Breakfast Sandwich($12.00) would set us back $56.50
We should get here by 8 AM, so make sure that Dominic get's up.\
Since the theatre looks so premium, let's assume these tickets will be $25(price of a large drink to share or even just popcorn) which will run at $125 altogether.  Let's catch a matinee.
After the movie, we can go to Leo's Taco Stand. This will be the affordable meal of the day, something authentic and easy. This meal will extremely affordable, and I've heard that you can get stuff there for just a dollar.
It is cash only, so we'll have to stop at the ATM beforehand, let's say after the movie.  We should expect to spend under $10 unless I'm feel like splurging where I might spend more like $15 so let's say $55 altogether.
After the movie, we'll go to Hollywood Pantages Theatre, which is 16 minutes away from the theatre, but we need to make sure and get a good seat and everything so I say we leave about 2 hours(+traffic time) prior to the performance.  This is an extremely expensive part of the trip, $417, but it will be amazing...
To finish off our day, we have dessert at -8 Degrees Celsius Ice Cream.  We can each drop about $40 between the bunch of us.
