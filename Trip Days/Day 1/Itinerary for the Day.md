# Day 1 Itinerary
___

We will arrive in Los Angeles, California on December 17, 2017 at 9:42am.  From here, we will gather our luggage and catch an Uber to get our rental vehicle.

After getting our vehicle we are going to drive to the [Daily Grill](http://www.dailygrill.com/menu/brunch/pancakes-waffles/), which is a good place for brunch assuming we get there around 11:00am.

After our brunch we will go to our rental home to drop off our luggage.  Then, to start the vacation, we will head to Griffith's Observatory and Hollywood sign.  This location gives you the best view of LA from ocean to the mountains.  Great for anyone who has never been to the west coast!  Along with seeing the iconic Hollywood sign.  Parking here is free, but does cost $0.50 per person to shuttle up to the observatory.

Next, we are going to head to Rodeo Dr., which is a well-known street for having the nicest designer clothing and retail stores.  It is fun to look at all of the expensive items, and maybe purchase a $800 sweater, on your own dime.  We will also have lunch near here at [Via Alloro](http://viaalloro.com/).  Parking is free on two-hour intervals, and then goes to $15 for the rest of the day.

After we are done with our adventures in Beverly Hills, and Hollywood, we will begin our journey back towards Pasadena.  It will take a while to get there, and after we refresh ourselves at the house we'll then head to [Ruth's Chris Steak House](https://www.ruthschris.com/restaurant-locations/pasadena) in Pasadena.  We'll enjoy some dinner, and mainly drinks were.  It'll just be a social hangout, and if anyone is feeling like doing something after that is up to them.
